# Laravel Cashier ðŸ’¸

![Art image for laravel-cashier](https://banners.beyondco.de/Laravel%20Cashier.png?theme=light&packageManager=composer+require&packageName=damms005%2Flaravel-cashier&pattern=glamorous&style=style_1&description=An+opinionated+Laravel+package+for+handling+payments%2C+complete+with+blade+views&md=1&showWatermark=1&fontSize=100px&images=cash&widths=350)

An opinionated Laravel package to handle payments, complete with blade views, routing, and everything in-between.

Whether you want to quickly bootstrap payment processing for your Laravel applications, or you want a way to test supported payment processors, this package's got you covered.

> Although opinionated, this package allows you to "theme" the views. It achieves this theming by
> `@extend()`ing whatever view you specify in `config('laravel-cashier.extended_layout')` (defaults to `layout.app`). This provides a smooth Plug-and-play&trade; experience.

## Currently supported payment handlers

Currently, this package supports the following online payment processors/handlers

-   [Paystack](https://paystack.com)
-   [Flutterwave](https://flutterwave.com)
-   [UnifiedPayments](https://unifiedpayments.com)
-   [Interswitch](https://www.interswitchgroup.com)
-   [Remita](http://remita.net)

> Your preferred payment handler is not yet supported? Please consider [opening the appropriate issue type](https://github.com/damms005/laravel-cashier/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=addition-of-new-payment-handler.md&title=Addition+of+new+payment+handler+-+%5Bpayment+handler+name+here%5D).

> Adding a new payment handler is straight-forward. Simply add the new payment class to the `Damms005\LaravelCashier\Services\PaymentHandlers` namespace and implement `Damms005\LaravelCashier\Contracts\PaymentHandlerInterface`

## Installation

Install via composer.

```bash
composer require damms005/laravel-cashier
```

Publish the config file.

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=laravel-cashier-config
```

Run migrations.

```
php artisan migrate
```

## Usage

### Test drive ðŸš€

Want to take things for a spin? simply visit `/payment/test-drive` (`route('payment.test-drive')`) .
For [Paystack](https://paystack.com), ensure to set `paystack_secret_key` key in the `laravel-cashier.php` config file that you published previously at installation. You can get your key from your [settings page](https://dashboard.paystack.co/#/settings/developer).

#### Needed Third-party Integrations:

-   Flutterwave: If you want to use Flutterwave, ensure to get your API details [from the dashboard](https://dashboard.flutterwave.com/dashboard/settings/apis), and use it to set the following environmental variables:

```
FLW_PUBLIC_KEY=FLWPUBK-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx-X
FLW_SECRET_KEY=FLWSECK-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx-X
FLW_SECRET_HASH='My_lovelysite123'
```

-   Paystack: Paystack requires a secret key to interact. Go to [the Paystack dashboard](https://dashboard.paystack.co/#/settings/developer) to obtain one, and use it to set the following environmental variable:

```
PAYSTACK_SECRET_KEY=FLWPUBK-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx-X
```

-   Remita: Ensure to set the following environmental variables:

```
REMITA_MERCHANT_ID=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx-X
REMITA_API_KEY=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx-X
```

> For most of the above environmental variables, you should rather use the (pubished) config file to set the corresponding values.

### Typical process-flow

#### Step 1

Send a `POST` request to `/payment/details/confirm` (`route('payment.show_transaction_details_for_user_confirmation')`).
Check the [InitiatePaymentRequest](src/Http/Requests/InitiatePaymentRequest.php#L28) form request to know the values you are to post to this endpoint. (tip: you can also check [test-drive/pay.blade.php](views/test-drive/pay.blade.php))

#### Step 2

Upon user confirmation of transaction, user is redirected to the appropriate payment handler's gateway.

#### Step 3

When user is done with the transaction on the payment handler's end (either successfully paid, or declined transaction), user is redirected
back to `/api/payment/completed` (`route('payment.finished.callback_url')`) .

> Ensure that your `User` model has a `name` property (Laravel's default). If you have removed the column for any reason, you may use [Model Accessor](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/eloquent-mutators#accessors-and-mutators) to provide same. For Remita, ensure that `phone` property also exists on the User model.

> If there are additional steps you want to take upon successful payment, listen for `SuccessfulLaravelCahierPaymentEvent`. It will be fired whenever a successful payment occurs, with its corresponding `Payment` model.

## Payment Conflict Resolution (PCR)

If for any reason, your user/customer claims that the payment they made was successful but they your platform did not reflect such successful payment, this PCR feature enables you to resolve such claims by simply calling:

```
/**
* @var bool //true if payment was successful, false otherwise
**/
$outcome = LaravelCashier::reQueryUnsuccessfulPayment( $payment )
```

The payment will be re-resolved and the payment will be updated in the database. You can them run any domain/application-specific procedures based on `$outcome` above

## Testing

```bash
composer test
```
